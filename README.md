# Robin Victory Fix (Smashline 2)

Skyline plugin modifying Robin's win scripts to have voice lines and sound effects function properly on added slots (c08+)

Note that this plugin specifically is coded to follow the costume distribution of the base game, so any deviations (ie stacking multiple male slots in succession and vice versa) will result in mismatched audio.

Smashline 1 and Smashline 2 versions available.
